            <h3> 10/10 - "Love letter to Hollywood" - Marie Brown</h3>
            <p> Having just gotten back from seeing 'La La Land', it came to me that it was one of the best new release movies for me in a while. Visually, 'La La Land' is a gorgeous-looking film, with lots of vibrant colour that leap out at you from the screen while not having too much of a dizzying effect. The music and songs may induce, and has induced, mixed reactions, count me in as somebody who found the songs infectious, emotion-filled and with enough to make one top-tap and hum along. The musical numbers are winningly choreographed too with non-stop exuberance. The script is warm, funny, affectionate and poignant, and also with an honesty. It's not a complex script, nor did it need to be, and neither does it make the mistake of being too simple. The story is admittedly slight in places, then again so were the stories of even the best golden age musicals and they still managed to be classics because of how everything else was executed and because of the atmosphere. The chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone is amazing and they look so natural and at ease together, nothing looks false and it is easy to root for them and their conflicts. Both of them give terrific performances, performances so good that less than great singing was immediately forgotten about. All in all, a dream come true and totally banishes any blues and daily troubles away.</p>

            <h3> 7/10 - "Good, but not that good" - Anna Richards</h3>
            <p> The buzz is high. 'La La Land' directed by Damien Chazelle combines a well known formula, makes reverences to the golden period of the musical films in Hollywood, but also to some more modern film makers and their ideas and enjoys the participation of shining stars like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. What we get with 'La La Land' a collection of a few wonderful moments connected by an awfully schematic story. Boy meets girl, of course. Boy is an aspiring jazz musician in a time when real jazz seems to be in a descending slope of interest, Girl is an aspiring actress, working in a coffe shop. They both have visions and passion, but life is tough and art and success seldom meet for one person and almost never with personal happiness, or true love. From here on the story accumulates many of the possible stereotypes and too little artistic truth. Great scenes are not missing, actually this film has a number of memorable quotes, the problem is the rosy sweet materials on between. As much as I love Ryan Gosling and appreciate Emma Stone their chemistry on screen is not enough to sustain the film, and it actually makes their breaking even less credible. To wrap it up, 'La La Land' is not a bad movie, but it's not the greatest either. </p>

            <h3> 4/10 - "Overrated" - Michael Elliott</h3>
            <p> I have seen way more than 200 musicals, and most of them were better than 'La La Land' So, when I watched this film, it struck me that most of the people who rated it just hadn't seen many musicals. The 'story' moved at snails pace for the most part. A major plot whole when a character makes a major, life altering decision which is totally ignored as if it never happened. Perhaps there is a missing scene on the cutting room floor since this then permitted an alternate ending which, of course, made no sense. Finally, many others are right to note the lack of chemistry between Ryan and Emma. To vote anything close to an 8.9 you need memorable songs, great chemistry, ever greater singing and dance talents plus a story that makes sense rather then contradicting itself. Sadly, I found all these qualities totally lacking.</p>
